**COMP90072 - The Art of Scientific Computation**

**Grade**: 90%

This repository contains all of my work for The Art of Scientific Computation (COMP90072), an elective I took in my Master of Physics. This subject consisted of one assignment worth 100% of the final grade: a custom project based on an application of programming.

There were several possible project streams to pick that the project would have to be based on, and the project would last for several months until completion. I picked the sand-pile modelling stream, where the goal was to use sand-pile modelling to create a prototype solution to some problem based on reality. This project would consist of two components: a program(s) that would satisfy the problem, and a report that woudld explain the design, development, and output of the code. These two components would be due at the same time, so I developed both together as the project progressed.

As a brief introduction
